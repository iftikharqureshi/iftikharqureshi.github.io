<h1>Draft Portfolio</h1>
<h2>1- Predicting Home Sale Prices Using Machine Learning (In Progress)</h2>
<p>This project uses supervised machine learning to predict home sale prices with the Ames Housing dataset. It compares linear regression, ridge, lasso, and Random Forest models, focusing on prediction accuracy and how easy each model is to interpret.</p>
